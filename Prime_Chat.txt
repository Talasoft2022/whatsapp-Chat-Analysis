12/5/22, 5:19 PM - +234 701 103 0557: Oh wow
12/5/22, 5:20 PM - +234 818 359 8830: @2347011030557 Could you ask another backend person who's in only one team?

So, we hard our first meeting today at 3 pm, and here is what we've come up with 

SECTOR: Healthcare Sector

PROBLEM SUGGESTIONS

1:  Documentation and record keeping 

2: Find hospitals, pharmacies, and health facilities around your environment

3: Lack of properly trained and compensated staff.
 
*We also considered looking into solving the common problems found in public hospitals, where doctors and nurses abandon patients to die when hospitals go on strike*


*We still need more ideas, so if you have any ideas you can drop them here* 

Also, we will be having our ideation/brainstorming section on Saturday. Let's suggest a time that will be best for us all.

Thanks!

12/9/22, 9:53 AM - +234 705 959 2726: Good morning my lovely TechAdas!

How are we doing? I hope we are all enjoying our day.

What time are we fixing for our brainstorming session tomorrow? @2347011030557 @2347066362982 @2348022578007 @2348038685226 @2348062261094 @2348064287477 @2348135676808 @2348166229879 @2348183598830 @2349024937385
12/9/22, 9:53 AM - +234 813 567 6808: 5pm?
12/9/22, 11:12 AM - +234 705 959 2726: Others should suggest their ideal time.

From my end, 5 pm is not okay for me, I prefer 8 pm but we still need to hear from others
12/9/22, 11:12 AM - +234 705 959 2726: Or 7:30 pm
12/9/22, 11:13 AM - camelCase: I am not comfortable with 5pm too
12/9/22, 11:14 AM - camelCase: Ejibode, would you please give us a broad range of time you would prefer?
12/9/22, 11:15 AM - +234 813 567 6808: Anytime you choose from 5pm downwards is fine
12/9/22, 11:15 AM - camelCase: I noticed you weren't in the last meeting, and you are one of the persons we are counting on their experiences in the health sector
12/9/22, 11:15 AM - +234 813 567 6808: Yes,I wasn't there.
12/9/22, 11:23 AM - camelCase: Maybe we should allow others to propose too
12/9/22, 11:24 AM - camelCase: The only exception i have is btw 4.30 and 6.30pm
12/9/22, 11:48 AM - Backend: 5PM
PLEASE
12/9/22, 11:50 AM - camelCase: This just came to my mind. There are a lot of people on the streets in nigeria with various life threatening conditions begging for funds for their treatment. What if we create a platform where such people can go to register, and samaritans can go to donate to them
12/9/22, 11:52 AM - camelCase: We would hasten their access to funding and take them off the streets
12/9/22, 11:54 AM - camelCase: Backend too?
12/9/22, 11:54 AM - camelCase: Tomorrow is Saturday na
12/9/22, 11:56 AM - +234 813 567 6808: Nicd
12/9/22, 11:56 AM - +234 813 567 6808: Nice*
12/9/22, 12:10 PM - +234 813 567 6808: Many of our patients come to hospital as early as 4am and some of them won't leave until 8-9pm.
They go through a lot of straight,the waiting time to see the doctors is long because it requires a lot of processes, from registration (at the health record,if it is a new patient, subjective data such as age, name, education background,  past medications history, family history has to be gotten from each patient), payment of consultation fee,then the nurses will triad them (by checking their vital signs such as BP, blood glucose,BMI, height, weight,pulse rate,heart rate etc),
All these elongate the time spent in the hospital.
Most of them will come into the Pharmacy tired and exhausted already and would not even want to pay attention to how best to take their medications to give the therapeutic effect desired.
Although we are using software in my hospital,we don't do paper work again,but still I still feel the time patients spend in the hospital is still much.
12/9/22, 12:13 PM - +234 813 567 6808: If we can come up with the idea where by there would not be need for the patients to be in the hospital premises before they can make their payments,then if possible,if the subjective data can be gotten from them from the comfort of their houses such that when they come ,they will just go straight to nurses and have their vitals checked,then to doctor then to Pharmacy.
12/9/22, 12:16 PM - +234 813 567 6808: And for the patients that come for refills of their medications,if there can be a way to pay their money from their homes,and the pharmacist just dispense,there won't be need for one on one counselling again since it's their routine drugs,then maybe a dispatch rider can then deliver it to them in their houses.
I believe this will improve the quality of life of the patients.
12/9/22, 12:17 PM - +234 813 567 6808: When I think of other problems,I will try and drop it here again.
12/9/22, 12:19 PM - +234 806 226 1094: Any time from 6pm is fine.
12/9/22, 3:03 PM - +234 705 959 2726: This sounds very nice
12/9/22, 3:06 PM - +234 705 959 2726: This makes sense too
12/9/22, 3:09 PM - +234 705 959 2726: I won't be available from 4 pm to 6:30 pm tomorrow, that's why I'm suggesting 7:30 or 8 pm

Provide a platform where patients input their subjective data and make payments from the comfort of their homes before getting to the hospital.

12/10/22, 8:52 PM - +234 813 567 6808: The problem is time waiting for the patients when they come to hospitats is unbearable and they get frustrated and exhausted before they leave.
Most of them are always eager to go their various homes,they would not listen to Pharmacist's advice on the proper way of using their medications to have a therapeutic effect.
Most of them end up using overdose.
12/10/22, 10:08 PM - +234 705 959 2726: *Thanks to everyone that joined the brainstorming session But I'm not happy that many of us didn't join*

12/10/22, 10:15 PM - +234 705 959 2726: We have two critical problem solutions identified but we are finding it difficult to choose one to go with for now.

*Let's cast a vote, the solution with the highest vote wins üëá*
12/10/22, 10:21 PM - +234 705 959 2726: Solution 1

A web platform where patients fill in their subjective data and make payments from the comfort of their homes before getting to the hospital to have their vitals checked before meeting the doctor. And also the patient coming for the refill of their medication makes their payments from the comfort of their homes while the pharmacist dispense and give a dispatch rider to deliver to them
12/10/22, 10:23 PM - +234 705 959 2726: Solution 2

Providing a platform where those who couldn't afford hospital bills can easily find donors and aid for their medical treatment.
12/10/22, 10:25 PM - +234 705 959 2726: *We have from now to 12 noon tomorrow to cast our vote.*

I need our corrections pls
12/11/22, 3:00 PM - +234 705 959 2726: PROBLEM STATEMENT

There are a lot of  Nigerians with various life-threatening conditions begging for funds for their treatment. Some print handbills and walk from street to street begging and soliciting for funds while some make posts on their social media handles soliciting for funds. Most of the time they don't really get the help they need and some, most especially the celebrities among them, get criticized without being helped. The worst part of it is that most of them don't make it, they die on the sick bed.

The solution we are providing will give Nigerians in this category a platform where they can easily register to get donations or aid for their medical treatment.

12/11/22, 4:35 PM - camelCase: Maybe you can tell us what you expect to be in the summary
12/11/22, 4:48 PM - Backend: There are numerous Nigerians suffering from life-threatening medical conditions who are struggling to obtain funds to cover the costs of their treatment. Some circulate handbills and travel from street to street in order to solicit donations, while others post requests for aid on their social media accounts. Unfortunately, many of these individuals receive little or no help, and are often met with criticism rather than support. Tragically, many of them succumb to their illness without receiving the necessary medical care.

We are proposing a platform that will allow Nigerians in this situation to register for donations or other forms of assistance for their medical treatments.
12/11/22, 4:49 PM - Backend: I rephrased it

12/12/22, 6:23 PM - +234 705 959 2726: If we all have agreed to go  with DonoH, then our designers should help us design a brand guide and a logo
12/12/22, 6:48 PM - +234 818 359 8830: True but we have to decide on the colour theme of the brand first
12/12/22, 7:15 PM - +234 705 959 2726: You are right
12/12/22, 7:16 PM - +234 705 959 2726: So, lets suggest brand color.

At most 3 colors, at least 2 colors

12/12/22, 10:26 PM - +234 705 959 2726: Whichever one that works best, our designers should use it and give us a beautiful design, brand guide and logo
